<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>To provide the client with a product that succesfully adheres to their design requests. In order to achieve this, the product must include all aspects requested by the client and, if needed, include aditional aspects that may impress the client. These additional aspects must be practical and relative to the topic. In addition, the product must not rely on these additional aspects as the client may be unhappy with them and want them removed. In this case, backup options can be used or current aspects can be reflected on and changed based on the clients evaluation. However, since this project does not have a timeframe that extends past the drafting stage or a client, draft level aspects will be added without the need of backups or the need to remove/replace.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>The success of the website will be measured in 2 ways. Firstly, the amount of visits made the website iteself will be monitored and evaluated to give an idea of the amount of traffic the website is recieving. Secondly, since the first method is unreliable, CossiePlay can ask new patrons of how they heard about their business. If new party-goers or customers found CossiePlay through this new website, we have a productive method of measuring the success of the website. </p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>This website will be geared towards students and young adults, while at the same time appealing to current customer base of 35 - 50 year olds. Due to the businesses lack of younger customers and clients, the aim of this website is the attract and appeal to the younger generation. In order to achieve this, the website should include familar cosplay characters and costumes for the younger generation as well as some older classics for the existing audience. This will allow existing fans to appreciate some new content as well as enjoy their all time classics, while appealing more so to the younger audience.</p>
